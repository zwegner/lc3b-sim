LC3b sim
========

This is a basic simulator for the [LC3b architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3#The_LC-3b). Actually, it's three simulators, using different types of simulation strategies (Event-based, Latch-based, and Data Flow Analysis). They are all cycle-accurate (which is the only reason to use these strategies in the first place).

This was written in 2009 as an extracurricular activity after talking with the TA from Yale Patt's Computer Architecture class (Aater Suleman). It was basically putting the stuff he taught me about simulators into action. Perhaps it will be of some use to you... Don't use this to cheat in some class, though.
